      "Having trouble meeting those pesky art museum standards?? lol, JK... but seriously. I built a mini art museum from an extra Amazon box I had after a shipment of art supplies were delivered. I had a couple packs of SO MANY art post cards I bought a few years ago and never really used them for anything. Now I have a museum that can be changed and rearranged. It's like a doll house for art! I hope my students have fun with it.",
